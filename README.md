## Simple Architecture

![Architecture](./_images/Architecture.png)

## Tech Stacks

- Next.js + Node.js + MySQL + Steampipe + Prisma(ORM)

## Usage

- First, You should know how to [set your credential](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) in steampipe directory.
- But, You can test this project on your local machine. For exmaple,
  - If you wanna test this system on your only one account? You have to delete about '\*sub1' in steampipe directory files(aws.spc, credentials, config)

```bash
# Current /steampipe/config file
[default]
region = ap-northeast-2
output=json

[sub1]
region = ap-northeast-2
output=json
```

- You create and set the 'credentials' file like below,

```bash
# /steampipe/credentials file
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

[sub1]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

- If you wanna edit 'aws.spc' ? You can!

```bash
# /steampipe/aws.spc file
connection "aws_master" {
  plugin  = "aws"
  profile = "default"
  regions = ["ap-northeast-2"]

  options "connection" {
    cache     = false # true, false
    cache_ttl = 300  # expiration (TTL) in seconds
  }
}

connection "aws_sub1" {
  plugin    = "aws"
  profile   = "sub1"
  regions   = ["ap-northeast-2"]

  options "connection" {
    cache     = false # true, false
    cache_ttl = 300  # expiration (TTL) in seconds
  }
}

connection "aws_all" {
  plugin      = "aws"
  type        = "aggregator"
  connections = ["aws_master", "aws_sub1"]
}
```

- And now you run the script.

```bash
# You have to install Node.js, docker
# And run the docker on your local machine
# before run this command below
$ ./run.sh
```

- Finally, You have to check this application's status.

```bash
$ docker logs vision

```

- Access http://localhost on your own browser.(Chrome recommended)
- Then, You'll see this screen below
  ![Login](./_images/Login.png)
  - **[IMPORTANT] THE FIRST USER TO LOGIN BECOMES AN ADMIN.**
- You'll see the query page after log in
  ![Main](./_images/Main.png)
- Press the 'Submit' button or ctrl(command) + enter, then you can see the result below
  ![Query](./_images/Query.png)
- Edit your query like below

```sql
SELECT
    account_id as account,
    region,
    group_id,
    group_name,
    security_group_rule_id,
    ip_protocol as protocol,
    CASE
        WHEN cidr_ip IS NULL
        THEN cidr_ipv6
        ELSE cidr_ip
        END AS ip,
    CASE
        WHEN from_port = to_port
        THEN from_port::varchar
        ELSE from_port::varchar || '-' || to_port::varchar
        END AS port
FROM
    aws_vpc_security_group_rule
WHERE
    type = 'ingress'
    AND (cidr_ip = '0.0.0.0/0' OR cidr_ipv6 = '::/0')
```

- See the results and Submit the above query with CATEGORY is 'COMPLIANCE' / TYPE is 'VPC' / NAME is 'SG_INGRESS_ANY_OPEN' and Click the 'Save Query'
  ![Result](./_images/Result.png)
- Select 'Vulnerability' in left side bar, and you can see your query's results(If no results, Maybe wait for 10s maximum.)
  ![Vuln](./_images/Vuln.png)
  - **[IMPORTANT] The current setting runs a saved query every 10 seconds and synchronizes the results every 300 seconds**
- If you wanna except your result then, you click the 'Exception' button and type your reason
  ![Except](./_images/Except.png)
- You can see the 'isDeleted' and 'isExcepted' on 'Regular Inspection' menu on left sidebar
  ![Regular](./_images/Regular.png)
- Now you should register 'CUSTOM' query. Click the 'Editor' on left sidebar and type the query like below

```sql
SELECT
  account_id,
  region,
  instance_id,
  title,
  instance_type,
  instance_state,
  iam_instance_profile_arn,
  metadata_options,
  private_ip_address,
  vpc_id,
  subnet_id,
  tags,
  security_groups,
  network_interfaces
FROM
  aws_ec2_instance
```

- And click the 'submit' button. Next, You can set CATEGORY is 'CUSTOM' / TYPE is 'EC2' / NAME is 'EC2_INFO'
  ![CUSTOM](./_images/CUSTOM.png)
- Now you can see this result in 'Resource' Menu.

## FAQ

- Can I use this system for other cloud like GCP, Azure etc?
  - Yes, But You have to edit your Dockerfile(/steampipe/Dockerfile) and create other files

    2. For example GCP, set your credential refering [this link](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/gcp)
- We have SSL Visualization system on our company. What can I do for install npm packages?
  - You have to set the "NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS" environment variable.
